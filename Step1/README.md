The `vector-add-serial.py` file contains a simple demonstration of "Vector Addition". But this raises two questions:

* What is a Vector?
* What does it mean to add two of them together?

A vector is just a list of numbers -- maybe they mean something in context (like GPS coordinates), but they don't always have to.


### Example
For example, consider the following two vectors:

* `A: [1,2,3]`
* `B: [4,5,6]`

When we say `C = A + B`, what we mean is that we are adding each "element" in order: the numbers in the first position get added, then the numbers in the second position get added, and so on.

This gives us:

* `C: [5,7,9]`
